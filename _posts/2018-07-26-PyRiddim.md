title: PyRiddim
summary: A totally unofficial Python wrapper for Riddimbase.org.
---
[Riddimbase.org](http://www.riddimbase.org/riddimbase.php) maintains an extensive database of dancehall riddims, who produced them, they label they came out on, what songs they became, who made those songs and what albums those songs ended up on. So I made a python app that pulls information from Riddimbase by riddim, producer, tune, artist and label, and nicely formats all that info using Pandas.

# Installation
To install with pip, run

`pip install PyRiddim.py`

You can also clone [the Git repository](https://github.com/afriedman412/PyRiddim) and run `python setup.py install`.

# Instructions
The `PyRiddim()` constructor takes `q` `q_type` and `track` as arguments, uses those arguments to search Riddimbase and stores the data as a Pandas dataframe.

- `q` is the search query
- `q_type` is what you are searching for (default is *riddim*, but can also be *artist*, *tune*, *label*, *album* or *producer*.)
- `track` toggles print statements while running the query (if ur impatient)

`track` defaults to *False*.

To see the search results, use the `.info` method.

# Example
How many songs does Riddimbase have for the artist Gyptian?

Run

`gyptian = PyRiddim(q='Gyptian', q_type='artist')`

to execute the search, then

`gyptian.info`

to see the results.
